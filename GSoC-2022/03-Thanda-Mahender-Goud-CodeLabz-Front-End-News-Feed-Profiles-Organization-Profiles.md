# Work Summary

During GSoC'22, I began working on the CodelabZ project's backend. For the first half of my GSoC experience, I worked on Firebase.
- Designed and implemented a new firebase local emulator suite that can replace the previous firebase blaze plan and is extremely efficient and practical for codelabz users.
- I also worked on firebase emulator operations like importing and exporting data from one database to another using simple import and export operations, which is currently a major feature of firebase.
- We improved the user interface and created reusable pages (home page,menu Items,new Org and User Profiles).New StoryBook is implemented by the team.
- In addition, for each component of our project, frontend tests (in Cypress) were added. Later,connected it to Github actions. Firestore was primarily used by codelabz for feature implementation and data storage (users, organizations) and updated to to the local emulator setup later.
- Finally, some existing bugs were fixed, and the project documentation was updated, including detailed instructions for configuring the firabse emulator and rulesets for data export and import over the databse. Codelabz is finally finished with all frontend and backend integration completed and all wikis for components and pages.
